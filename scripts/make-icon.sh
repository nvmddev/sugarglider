# Compile Resources/AppIcon.icon (an Icon Composer document) into the four
# artifacts the app bundle ships, all committed next to it:
#
#   Resources/Assets.car        the real icon: an image stack carrying separate
#                               Aqua / DarkAqua / tintable renditions, which is
#                               what makes macOS swap the icon with the system
#                               appearance. Referenced by CFBundleIconName.
#   Resources/AppIcon.icns      single-appearance fallback for anything that
#                               predates the catalog. Referenced by CFBundleIconFile.
#   Resources/AppIcon-Light.png the same artwork as flat images, for the About
#   Resources/AppIcon-Dark.png  tab, since the catalog's variants are reachable
#                               only through the system icon services, never
#                               through NSImage(named:).
#
# Run this only when the artwork changes; build.sh just copies the results.
# actool ships only with a full Xcode (26+ for .icon documents), while build.sh
# has to work on a Command Line Tools-only machine, and CI's pinned macos-15
# runners have neither. Committing what actool produced keeps every build
# reproducible without that dependency.
#
# Usage:
#   make-icon.sh [compile]   recompile the artifacts and record the source hash
#   make-icon.sh verify      check that hash without needing Xcode at all
#
# `verify` closes the loop on committing generated files: edit the artwork,
# forget to recompile, and the build would otherwise ship the old icon with
# every check green. CI runs it.

    ///   `MenuBarExtra(.window)` creates, so the dropdown would ignore the

    /// - Setting the window appearance retints *everything* consistently —
    ///   the glass material, SwiftUI semantic styles (`.primary` etc.), and
    ///   AppKit dynamic colors (`.labelColor`, `.separatorColor`) the chart
    ///   draws with. An environment-only override would leave the AppKit
    ///   colors resolving against the system appearance.
    /// - `NSApp.appearance` is deliberately NOT set: that would also retint
    ///   the status-bar item, which must follow the menu bar to stay legible.
    ///
    /// It does NOT work for the `Settings` scene window: SwiftUI manages that
    /// window's `appearance` itself and resets a manual override milliseconds
    /// after it's applied (verified via KVO on macOS 26). The Settings window
    /// uses `preferredColorScheme` instead — SwiftUI's own machinery then
    /// sets the window-level appearance, so AppKit dynamic colors follow too.

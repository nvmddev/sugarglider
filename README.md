Sugarglider is a tiny native menu-bar app for [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io)
users. It shows your latest reading, its trend arrow, and how fresh it is — e.g.
`5.6 ↗` — and opens a chart of recent history when clicked. No Dock icon, no
window clutter, no third-party services: just your Mac talking to your own
Nightscout site.

<!-- TODO: add a screenshot before publishing, e.g.

(capture with demo data, not real readings) -->

## Features

- **Glance value in the menu bar** — current glucose with trend arrow, updated
  on a configurable interval (3–300s, default 60s). Optionally shows the delta
  to the previous reading (`5.6 ↗ (+0.1)`). Once the newest reading is older
  than the stale delay — 11 minutes by default, adjustable from 5 to 240 minutes
  to suit how often your CGM and uploader actually deliver — it is marked with its age —
  `5.6 ↗ ⚠ 23m` — so a brief gap is easy to tell apart from a feed that
  stopped. Sugarglider never sends notifications and is not an alarm: it can
  only see your Nightscout site, so it cannot tell a sensor gap from an
  uploader or network one.
- **Chart dropdown** — click the item for a smoothed chart of the last
  2–72 hours (up to 3 days), adjustable with a slider in 2h steps or by typing
  any whole number of hours into the field beside it (remembered across
  launches). Value
  gridlines, a dashed band marking your target range, and hover to inspect any
  point's exact value and time. Sensor dropouts (gaps > 15 min) break the line
  instead of interpolating across them.
- **Zone colors** — the line is colored by zone (very low / below / in range /
  above / very high), either switching at each threshold or blending smoothly.
  Every color is independently pickable with opacity, and the monochrome
  defaults follow Light/Dark mode. A whole look — all colors plus the blending,
  shading and dot options below — can be saved as a named preset and switched
  back to at any time.
- **Tunable chart details** — the shading under the line can be switched off or
  given its own color, the dot on the latest reading has adjustable size and
  halo (either down to zero to hide it) and can keep its zone color or take a
  fixed one, and the range slider's track color is yours to pick. A live preview
  in Settings shows every change as you make it.
- **mmol/L or mg/dL** — switch the display unit any time; values are stored in
  mg/dL (Nightscout's native unit), so nothing drifts on conversion.
- **Configurable thresholds** — target range and very-low/very-high bounds,
  edited in your display unit. Numbers always use a dot as the decimal
  separator, whatever your region is set to. Settings points out thresholds that
  are out of order (very low ≤ low < high ≤ very high) rather than quietly
  rewriting what you typed.
- **Light/Dark override** — follow the system or force a theme, applied to the
  dropdown and Settings window.
- **Native and lightweight** — pure Swift + SwiftUI, zero dependencies, a
  ~350 KB binary, and one small HTTP request per refresh interval in the
  background.

## Requirements

- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer
- A reachable [Nightscout](https://nightscout.github.io) site
- To build: Xcode 16+ or the Xcode Command Line Tools (Swift 6)

## Install

### Download

Grab the latest `.dmg` (or `.zip`) from the
[releases page](https://github.com/nvmddev/sugarglider/releases/latest) and drag
**Sugarglider.app** into `/Applications`. The build is a universal binary, so it
runs natively on both Apple silicon and Intel.

Releases are signed with an Apple Developer ID certificate and notarized by
Apple, with the ticket stapled to both the app and the disk image. macOS opens
them without a Gatekeeper prompt and without any `xattr` incantation.

Every release ships a `checksums.txt`; verify your download with
`shasum -a 256 -c checksums.txt`.

### Homebrew

```sh
brew install --cask nvmddev/tap/sugarglider
```

### Build from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nvmddev/sugarglider.git
cd sugarglider
./build.sh
cp -r Sugarglider.app /Applications/
open /Applications/Sugarglider.app
```

To launch it automatically at login: **System Settings → General → Login
Items** → add Sugarglider.

## Setup

The menu-bar item shows `CGM ⚙` until configured. Click it, then
**Settings…** (or press ⌘, while the dropdown is open) and enter:

- **Nightscout URL** — e.g. `https://your-site.nightscout.app`
- **Access token** — create one in Nightscout under *Admin Tools → Subjects*
  with a read role (`readable`). Leave it empty if your site allows
  unauthenticated reads. The field masks the token whenever it isn't focused.

Settings apply immediately — there is no Save button — and the General tab
shows a live **Connected** / failure status for the URL and token as you type.
The Colors and Glucose tabs hold the palette and threshold options; About shows
the running version, which is what to quote when reporting a problem.

## Trend arrows

| Arrow | Nightscout direction |
|-------|----------------------|
| ↑↑    | DoubleUp             |
| ↑     | SingleUp             |
| ↗     | FortyFiveUp          |
| →     | Flat                 |
| ↘     | FortyFiveDown        |
| ↓     | SingleDown           |
| ↓↓    | DoubleDown           |

## How it works

Sugarglider polls `GET {url}/api/v1/entries/sgv.json?count=2` on the refresh
interval set in Settings → General (3–300s, default 60s; the second entry
supplies the delta), with generous timer tolerance so macOS can coalesce
wakeups for minimal energy use. Chart history is fetched only when the dropdown
opens, and at most once per minute regardless of the refresh interval. Only the
selected window is requested, and only once: after that the cache is topped up
with `find[date][$gt]=<newest cached entry>`, which normally returns a handful
of readings or none at all — and the entries the 60s poll already carries are
folded in, so opening the dropdown often needs no request. Narrowing the range
re-slices cached data; widening it past what has been fetched pulls the missing
history once.

Your data never goes anywhere else: the app talks exclusively to the
Nightscout URL you configure, and there is no telemetry, analytics, or other
third-party traffic. The URL and token are stored in the app's user defaults
on your Mac.

## Development

```sh
swift build     # debug build
swift test      # run the test suite (needs Xcode, not just the CLT)
./build.sh      # release build + assemble Sugarglider.app
```

CI builds and tests every push and pull request on macOS, including a universal
(arm64 + x86_64) release build, and lints the shell scripts and workflows.

Contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the setup,
the architecture in a paragraph, and the commit-message convention (the changelog
and version numbers are generated from it). Past releases are in
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Releasing

Maintainers only. Two ways in, both landing in the same
[release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml):

```sh
# Let the workflow pick the version from the Conventional Commits since the
# last tag, then tag, build and publish:
gh workflow run release.yml -f bump=auto

# …or force a level, or rehearse without publishing anything:
gh workflow run release.yml -f bump=minor
gh workflow run release.yml -f bump=auto -f dry_run=true

# …or just push a tag yourself:
git tag v1.2.0 && git push origin v1.2.0
```

The workflow runs the tests, builds a universal signed bundle, packages a `.zip`,
a `.dmg` and `checksums.txt`, generates the release notes from the commit log,
publishes the GitHub release, and opens a `docs/changelog-vX.Y.Z` pull request
with the updated `CHANGELOG.md` — `main` is protected, so it can't push there
directly. That PR merges itself once CI is green, provided a `RELEASE_PAT`
secret exists (see below); without one it waits for you to close and reopen it,
which is what starts its checks.

Nothing releases on its own: landing a commit on `main` only runs CI. `bump=auto`
additionally refuses when nothing under `Sources/`, `Resources/` or
`Package.swift` has changed since the last tag — a run of CI-only or docs-only
commits would otherwise ship a byte-identical app under a new number. Pass an
explicit `bump=patch` (or push a tag) when you want that anyway.

Everything it does is a script you can run locally, which is the point — a
release should never be a black box:

```sh
scripts/version.sh next auto            # what would the next version be?
scripts/version.sh app-changed          # …and would the app actually differ?
scripts/release-notes.sh 1.2.0          # what would the notes say?
VERSION=1.2.0 UNIVERSAL=1 ./build.sh    # the exact bundle CI produces
VERSION=1.2.0 scripts/make-dmg.sh
```

### Optional repository configuration

Everything below is optional — without it releases still build and publish,
just ad-hoc signed and without the Homebrew cask.

| Secret / variable            | Type     | Effect when set                                         |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_P12`      | secret   | Developer ID cert (base64 `.p12`); enables real signing |
| `MACOS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | secret   | Password for that `.p12`                                |
| `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY`        | secret   | e.g. `Developer ID Application: Name (TEAMID)`          |
| `APPLE_ID`                   | secret   | Apple ID; enables notarization and stapling             |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID`              | secret   | Team ID for notarization                                |
| `APPLE_APP_PASSWORD`         | secret   | App-specific password for notarization                  |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN`         | secret   | PAT with `contents:write` on the tap; updates the cask  |
| `HOMEBREW_TAP_REPO`          | variable | Tap repo, defaults to `<owner>/homebrew-tap`            |
| `RELEASE_PAT`                | secret   | PAT (contents + pull requests) here; self-merges the PR |

Base64-encode the certificate with `base64 -i cert.p12 | pbcopy`. All of these
are set on this repository, so the workflow signs and notarizes on its own and
the release notes carry no Gatekeeper workaround. Without them it degrades
instead of failing — no certificate means an ad-hoc build, no `APPLE_ID` means
signed but unnotarized — which is why `scripts/verify-notarization.sh` runs on
the notarizing path and fails the release rather than letting a quarantined
download ship under green checks.

`RELEASE_PAT` is a fine-grained token on this repository with **Contents:
read and write** and **Pull requests: read and write**. It exists because
nothing pushed or opened with the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` starts a workflow
run: the changelog PR's required checks would never report and it could never
merge. It grants no extra power over `main` — that PR passes the same ruleset
as any other.
